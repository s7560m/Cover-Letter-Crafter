# Cover-Letter-Crafter
Uses job descriptions, searches for keywords, and produces optimal cover letter using those keywords. Testing out my vue.js knowledge as well for this project.


# Limitations
It uses string.includes() which is a function only present in the new ES6. While this does support most browsers, some browsers may be limited in functionality, like internet explorer (lol)

# How to use
Go to any job page and then copy and paste the job description. Once you're done that, type in the company in the first input field, the job position in the second input field, and then the job description in the third. Then after pressing generate, it should load.
